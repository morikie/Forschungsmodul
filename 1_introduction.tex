\section{Introduction}
Malaria is a disease that is responsible for half a million to one million human deaths every year. The pathogen (Plasmodium) is a unicellular, eukaryotic organism that lives parasitically in the human liver and blood stream. There are five known species of the Plasmodium Genus that infect humans: P. vivax, P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. ovale and P. knowlesi. Most deaths are caused by P. falciparum, however the high number of casualties can be attributed to mosquitos of the genera Culex and Anopheles, the vectors of the Plasmodium pathogens.
